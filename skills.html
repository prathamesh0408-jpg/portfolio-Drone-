      <li style="color: red">Design and drawing of mechanical systems:</li>
      <p>
        A fundamental skill that engineers from any discipline will need is
        creativity for designing and drawing mechanical systems. Creativity
        allows mechanical engineers to visualize and develop a project from
        complex designs whilst working to appropriate industry safety standards.
        Attention to detail is also necessary to be aware of how to adapt
        designs to accommodate other vital aspects of a project. Therefore,
        knowing where vital systems, machinery or equipment will be best located
        is a core competence that you should demonstrate on your resume.
      </p>
      <li style="color: red">Innovation:</li>
      <p>
        To be successful in obtaining a role as a mechanical engineer, you’ll
        need to demonstrate sound technical skills, an understanding of
        mechanical engineering principles, and their application to varied
        projects and domains. However, by showing you can innovate you’ll be in
        with a better chance of getting noticed.
      </p>
      <li style="color: red">Problem-solving:</li>
      <p>
        Problem-solving is a key skill to master in any job. In construction,
        mechanical engineers must apply a range of principles to deliver
        successful project outcomes, manage complex technical challenges, and be
        directly accountable for the quality and technical performance of
        engineering projects.
      </p>
      <li style="color: red">Critical Thinking:</li>
      <p>
        Critical thinking is the intellectually disciplined process of actively
        and skillfully conceptualizing, applying, analyzing, synthesizing,
        and/or evaluating information gathered from, or generated by,
        observation, experience, reflection, reasoning, or communication, as a
        guide to belief and action.
